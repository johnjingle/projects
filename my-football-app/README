The project can be imported into Eclipse as a maven project.

The file "football-results.txt" to be processed should be of the agreed format and reside in the project home directory 
if running in Eclipse.

If the application is run from the command line in the target directory using 
java -jar my-football-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
then the file should be present there.

In the project directory run
mvn test 
to run the unit tests.
